## Complete System Interconnections & Interface Architecture

### Platform Architecture Overview

WaituMusic operates as a **comprehensive ecosystem** where every component interfaces and interconnects with multiple other systems to create seamless workflows. The platform's power comes from these intricate relationships and data flows that create a unified music industry management experience.

### 🔄 Core System Integration Matrix

#### **1. User Management & Authentication System**

**Central Hub**: `AuthContext.tsx` manages global user state and role-based access control

**Interconnections**:
- **Role-Based Dashboard Routing**: Authentication data flows to `SuperadminDashboard.tsx` and `UnifiedDashboard.tsx` to determine user interface and available features
- **Profile Data Synchronization**: User profile updates trigger cascading updates across:
  - Artist/Musician/Professional profile tables in database schema
  - Booking form picture URLs for managed users
  - Technical rider profile data for automated form population
  - OppHub AI prioritization based on management status
- **Real-Time Permission Checking**: Every API endpoint validates user permissions through `authenticateToken` middleware
- **Cross-Component State Management**: Authentication state propagates to all modals, forms, and workflow components

**Database Schema Relationships**:
```typescript
users.id → artists.userId → songs.artistUserId → bookings.primaryArtistUserId
users.roleId → roles.id (determines platform access level)
users.id → userProfiles.userId (extended profile information)
users.id → managementTiers.id (subscription and feature access)
```

#### **2. Booking Workflow System**

**Central Orchestrator**: `TechnicalRiderWorkflow.tsx` coordinates multi-component booking processes

**Complex Interconnections**:

**Stage 1: Booking Creation to Assignment**
```
BookingForm → bookings table → BookingAssignments → 
ProfessionalAssignments → InternalBookingObjectives → 
TechnicalRiderWorkflow
```

**Stage 2: Technical Rider Integration**
- **Stage Plot Designer** (`EnhancedStageDesigner`) creates visual layouts
- **32-Port Mixer Configuration** (`Enhanced32PortMixer`) reads stage plot data for channel assignment
- **Setlist Manager** (`EnhancedSetlistManager`) integrates with YouTube API and OppHub AI for song recommendations
- **PDF Generation System** combines all components into professional technical rider documents

**Cross-System Data Flow**:
```typescript
// Booking triggers professional assignment
bookingAssignments.bookingId → bookings.id
bookingAssignments.assignedUserId → users.id → professionals.userId

// Technical rider auto-populates from user profiles
users.id → musicians.technicalRiderProfile → TechnicalRiderWorkflow.workflowData
users.id → artists.technicalRiderProfile → StageDesigner.defaultPreferences

// Internal objectives hidden from bookers
internalBookingObjectives.bookingId → bookings.id
internalBookingObjectives.confidential = true (role-based visibility)
```

#### **3. OppHub Opportunities Marketplace**

**Central Marketplace**: `oppHubMarketplace.ts` coordinates opportunities between talent users and agents

**Marketplace Data Flow Architecture**:
