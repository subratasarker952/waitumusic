- **`getAlbumsByArtist`** - Removed duplicate at line 1938, keeping original at line 1214  
- **`createAlbum`** - Removed duplicate at lines 1942-1948, keeping original at line 1218

### 2. Cross-Upsell Methods (Lines 3899-3917)
- **`createCrossUpsellRelationship`** - Removed duplicate at line 3899, keeping original at line 1873
- **`getCrossUpsellRelationships`** - Removed duplicate at lines 3907-3917, keeping original at line 1869

### 3. Opportunities Methods (Multiple duplicates)
- **`getOpportunities`** - Removed duplicate simple version at line 6085, keeping enhanced version with filters at line 5255
- **`createOpportunity`** - Removed duplicate at line 6089, keeping original at line 5253
- **`updateOpportunity`** - Removed duplicate at line 6094, keeping original at line 5298
- **`deleteOpportunity`** - Removed duplicate at line 6103, keeping original at line 5306

- **`updateOpportunitySourceLastScraped`** - Removed duplicate at line 6161, keeping original at line 5656
- **`getOpportunityMatches`** - Removed duplicate at line 6172, keeping original at line 5666
- **`createOpportunityMatch`** - Removed duplicate at line 6185, keeping original at line 5680
- **`updateOpportunityMatchInteraction`** - Removed duplicate at line 6190, keeping original at line 5685

## Resolution Strategy:

1. **Pattern Analysis**: Used `grep -n` to identify exact line numbers of duplicate methods
2. **Kept First Implementation**: Preserved original implementations that were properly integrated with existing codebase
3. **Removed Later Duplicates**: Eliminated subsequent duplicate implementations that were likely added during development evolution
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All functionality preserved through original implementations

## Verification:
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ No LSP diagnostics found  
- ✅ No duplicate method warnings
- ✅ All database operations maintained
- ✅ OppHub AI systems operational

## Root Cause Prevention:
The `oppHubDuplicateMethodPrevention.ts` system has been enhanced to detect and prevent future duplicate methods through:
- Pre-commit method scanning
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement
- Automated duplicate detection alerts
- Development workflow pattern recognition
