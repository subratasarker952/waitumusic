Allow press releases to also be automatically generated when a managed artist (most likely) or managed musician wishes to do a release of a song that was coded or create an album (from the songs that were coded) or otherwise uploaded to the album/song release attachment/assignment area of the press release (assigned songs are songs that were coded and are available in the media area and which pertain to the managed artist(s) and/or managed musician assigned to the press release). Also the graphic files can be assigned from the media area or uploaded in high res. Put all else that would be necessary to capture information to make stellar press releases that OppHub can keep using all the information it can research or already knows to make suggestions on wording to achieve the objective of the press release, which can be asked of the assigned admin to the managed talent or superadmin to ensure the right and optimal wording is suggested and link this all too, to the social media campaign to follow the press release. Like if it is about an album release, knowing that most releases take 10 days minimum to propagate fully, to create posts for each and every platform for the days leading up to the release and to create for each and every song credible-looking lyrics videos where the wording is presented always in clear fashion and ask which of the song(s) in the press release (if multiple) are the titular ones and create music videos using stock footage from free sources or completely free ai-generated to ensure there is an abundance of content and reels and shorts to match the press release in this case. If it is other than album, then still create all the suggestions leading up to release date and up to one week after but this time generate the reels ideas and concepts for the days leading up to the targeted date for all social media. Expand on my idea to make it make perfect sense and do all is necessary to allow OppHub to learn how to do all these things and get increasingly better at it
