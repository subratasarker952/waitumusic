Management tiers determine approval requirements
Commission structures link financial aspects
Booking-Calendar Relationship:

Calendar availability affects booking options
Bookings block calendar dates automatically
Conflicts are prevented through calendar integration

The dashboard system is designed to provide role-specific functionality while maintaining a consistent user experience. Each user type sees only what's relevant to their role, with appropriate access controls and feature limitations. The relationships between dashboard elements ensure that actions in one area appropriately affect related areas, creating a cohesive and intuitive platform experience.
