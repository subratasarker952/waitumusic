Change "Melody creation percentages total 100% but cannot exceed 25%" to "Melody creation percentages total 100%"
Change "Songwriting percentages total 100% but cannot exceed 50%" to "Songwriting percentages total 100%"
Change "ISRC format: DM-WTM-YY-XXX (replaces "Reference" in all form headers)" to "ISRC format: DM-A0D-YY-NN-XXX (replaces "Reference" in all form headers)" Let me explain this format (DM-A0D-YY-NN-XXX): DM - Country where Wai'tuMusic is based, A0D - represents the identifier for Wai'tuMusic in Dominica received frrom the IFPI.ORG, YY- represents the current year and should be autofilled from the current year last two digits  so 2025 -> 25 (let OppHub monitor the IFPI for any formatting changes in this regard), NN - represents the Wai'tuMusic Managed Artist identifier starting from 00, XXX represents the number of the current release( 001, 003, 005 ...00[Odd numbers] for the primary release | 002 (pertains to 001 and is reserved to represent a remix version of the song released under 001), 003(original)->004(remix) ...00[odd numbers](original)->00[even numbers](remix) | putting a 9 before the final two numbers, indicates that this code it to be used for video synchronisation release purposes and we should advise the MP3 to be formatted to 48Khz and the video to be in ideally 24 fps)
Let me know if you understand the above and if you do, please tell me what you understand and what types of automations will you be able to create when a song is being submitted for ISRC coding. I can think of an idea, ask if the song is the original version. if it is not then we ask for the original to be uploaded first if available, else proceed because sometimes the remix can be available before the orginal for whatever reason. In the event that the original is being coded, then automatically present the following code-> DM-A0D-YY-NN-001 and DM-A0D-YY-NN-901. If the remix of an existing song, then ask the uploader to select the original song by presenting a dropdown that shows the song name and the ISRC. And then also create the DM-A0D-YY-NN-901 for the original and the DM-A0D-YY-NN-902 if the remix of the original.
