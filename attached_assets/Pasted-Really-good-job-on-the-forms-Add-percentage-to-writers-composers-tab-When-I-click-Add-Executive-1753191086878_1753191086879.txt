Really good job on the  forms!!! Add percentage to writers/composers tab. When I click Add Executive Producers I get a blank page. See that first page? it basically tells you how to format each entry in each form.  Song Reference Number is actually the reference to [SRF] in bold. So for example where you have WM-SSA-WC-Reference#1 should actually be dynamically formatted to WM-SSA-[Form shortname code]-[Song Reference Number]-[count]. So the first entry in the Writer/Composers document would be WM-SSA-WC-DMA0D2100001-1 and the second would be WM-SSA-WC-DMA0D2100001-2 etc, and like that for each form type.  Now in this format let me explain each part of the structure (WM-SSA-[Form shortname code]-[Song Reference Number]-[count]): WM = Wai'tuMusic; SSA=SplitSheet Agreement;Form Shortname Code= Writers/Composers - WC, Recording Artists -RA, Labels Document (we added the word Document to keep the two letter shortname code format)- LD,Studios Document -SD, Publishers Document- PD, Executive Producers -EP, Other Contributors- OC;Song reference Number= ISRC (offered by Wai'tuMusic, which is why it can only be offered to managed talent users); Count=the number of entries made.

Now, depending on negotiations (outside the scope of this document, but should certainly be justified in writing) Other Contributors can be assigned a percentage of any of the percentages for Author, Composer, Melody Creator etc. It can be done, but a reason has to be given.

As a general rule in the Splitsheet policy the forms involved in:
Songwriters/Authors(50%) = WC,RA, OC. So the total of their percentages for the lyrics component (which is why RA has the percentage for Lyrics Ownership){aka Authorship/Songwriting aspect} must equal 50%  Those in OC as mentioned before can be granted percentages in the Songwriting percentage
Melody Creators (25%) = RA, OC. So the total of their percentages are of the 25% assigned to the melody creation part of the song. This is why RA has a percentage of music ownership(you could in essence break it down into melody (25% total) and music composition (25% total) to be more accurate as there maybe that recording artist that has created their own music or contributed to the actual music composition, and also the melody of the song.
Beat/Production (25%) = OC (here we can add the details of the music producer/music composer and the percentage of the beat production/music composition) here too we can also add the musicians who helped create the music.
