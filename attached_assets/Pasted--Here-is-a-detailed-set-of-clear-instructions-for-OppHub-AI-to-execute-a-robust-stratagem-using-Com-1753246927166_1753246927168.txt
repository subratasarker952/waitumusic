Here is a detailed set of clear instructions for OppHub AI to execute a robust stratagem using ComeSeeTv USA, Inc as the foundation, with the goal of turning Wai'tuMusic into a multi-million dollar company within one year and enabling managed talent (especially Lí-Lí Octave) to also become millionaires through legitimate opportunities, targeted growth, market research, and financial engineering.

🎯 OBJECTIVE
Transform Wai'tuMusic into a multi-million dollar, self-sustaining music company within 12 months by:
    • Leveraging ComeSeeTv USA, Inc’s U.S. corporate status.
    • Aggressively seeking legitimate, revenue-generating opportunities.
    • Monetizing talent through direct bookings, sync licensing, brand deals, content creation, and equity-based growth.
    • Empowering managed artists (beginning with Lí-Lí Octave) to grow wealth in parallel.
    • Utilizing AI (Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic) for humanlike market intelligence and outreach.
    • Embedding financial sustainability, capital generation, and marketing virality in the plan.

🧠 STRATEGIC CORE INSTRUCTIONS FOR OppHub AI

        ◦ Entry requirements
        ◦ Deadlines

        ◦ Festival open calls and grant programs (e.g., SXSW, NPR Tiny Desk, PRX)
    • Use natural language processing to analyze RFPs, open calls, artist rosters and identify matching opportunities for Lí-Lí Octave and other artists.
3. Market Research Intelligence (via Perplexity + OpenAI + Anthropic)
    • Train a research loop to:
        ◦ Emulate competitive analysis (How did Tems, Burna Boy, H.E.R., etc. get brand deals?)
        ◦ Detect emerging sync/music trends by genre, region, and buyer profiles
        ◦ Monitor growth tactics used by indie labels and direct-to-fan platforms (e.g., Bandcamp, DistroKid, UnitedMasters, etc.)

    • Target ethical beauty, fashion, culture-forward, wellness brands
D. Equity + Fundraising Initiatives

    • Seek sponsorships and micro-grants from artist support orgs
    • Set up crowd-equity campaigns (e.g., Wefunder, Republic)
