**Issue:** PWA install prompt component not integrated into main app  
**Files:** `client/src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx` created but not used  
**Solution Required:** Mount PWAInstallPrompt in App.tsx

**Solution Required:** Add service worker registration to main app

### 3. Advanced Booking Workflow UI (High Priority)
**Expected:** Frontend interface for technical rider creation and approval workflows  
**Current Status:** Backend API endpoints operational but no UI components  
**Issue:** Frontend components for advanced booking workflows not created  
**Files:** Backend routes working, frontend components missing  
**Solution Required:** Create React components for advanced booking features

### 4. Managed Agent Assignment Interface (Medium Priority)
**Expected:** Admin interface to manage agent assignments and view metrics  
**Current Status:** Backend system complete but no admin interface  
**Issue:** No frontend for agent management capabilities
